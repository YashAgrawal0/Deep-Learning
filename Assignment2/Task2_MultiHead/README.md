```
### Run the program
   -   To run this code, first extract_line_data.ipynb and extract_line_data_4classes.ipynb should be run to get the ground truth.
   Guide on how to run the above codes are given in main README.md .
   -   Open the `task.ipynb` in the `Jupyter Notebook` and run all the cells. A folder `result` would be then created inside which three learning curves are present and results of our model are present in fine scores.txt and cm_angle.txt .
