### Libraries used
Following are the python libraries used:
```bash
numpy, os, matplotlib, keras, sklearn
```
### Run the program
   -   To run this code, first extract_line_data.ipynb should be run to get the ground truth.
   Guide on how to run the above code is given in main README.md .
   -   Codes for different parts are given in respective folders. 
   -   For `mnist` dataset,open the `mnist.ipynb` file present in each of the folders in the `Jupyter Notebook` and run all the cells. A folder `result` would be then created inside which three learning curves are present and results of our model are present in fine scores.txt and cm_angle.txt .
   -   For `line` dataset,open the `line.ipynb` file present in each of the folders in the `Jupyter Notebook` and run all the cells. A folder `result` would be then created inside which three learning curves are present and results of our model are present in fine scores.txt and cm_angle.txt .
