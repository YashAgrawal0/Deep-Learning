## Guide on how to run

### Language
Make sure you have `Python 2` setup in your `Jupyter Notebook`.

### Libraries used
Following are the python libraries used:
```bash
numpy, tensorflow, matplotlib, time
```

### Run the program
   -   First extract the `q2_input.zip` for the inputs.
   -   To run the tensorflow code, run `task2.ipynb` in your `Jupyter Notebook`. A file `./q2_output` would be created containing the `final_position.npy` and `final_velocity.npy` after applying the newton's law.
   -   Run the `task2_np.ipynb` in your `Jupyter Notebook` which is the same implementation by using only the `numpy` arrays.
