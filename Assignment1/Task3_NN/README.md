## Guide on how to run

### Language
Make sure you have `Python 3` setup in your `Jupyter Notebook`.

### Libraries
Following are the python libraries used:
```bash
tensorflow, matplotlib, os, numpy, cv2, math, random
```
### Run the program
   -   Run the `task3_mnist.ipynb` for the running the model on mnist dataset. Output folder in the format `x_x_x_x_x` would be created where `x` is the number of neurons in that hidden layer. Inside the folder two text files would be created (accuracy_fscore and confusion matrix) and two figures showing the graph of `loss_accuracy` and `iterations_accuracy`.
   -   Run the `task3_lines_img.ipynb` for running the model on the images dataset from the `Task1`.
   -   Find the `Assignment1_3.pdf` the report for this task.
